# CrimeFinder
A tool that utilizes UK police data APIs

Uses 2 APIs, 1 to look up longitudes and latitudes for a given postcode and another to lookup crime statistics in the given postcode area

## TODO
- Add Google maps view (Ability to view crime location on a map)
- Ability to specify a date range, currently it just looks at the most up to date statistics
